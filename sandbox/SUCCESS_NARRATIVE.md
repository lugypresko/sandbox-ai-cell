5-Minute Demo Success Narrative



Goal



Demonstrate that AI-CELL:



Understands system behavior



Acts with restraint



Improves stability without human intervention



Demo Storyline (CTO-facing)

Minute 0--1: Normal



System running



Metrics fluctuate naturally



AI-CELL in NORMAL



No decisions



Message:



"This is how the system behaves when nothing is wrong."



Minute 1--2: Introduce Drift



Latency gradually increases



No alerts fired



Humans would ignore this



AI-CELL:



Detects SOFT\_DRIFT



Moves to DEGRADED



No action taken



Message:



"The system notices risk before humans do -- but doesn't panic."



Minute 2--3: Escalation



Drift persists



Error rate increases slightly



AI-CELL:



Transitions to PRESSURE



Issues a recommendation



Explains why



Message:



"This is not anomaly detection. This is situational awareness."



Minute 3--4: Stabilization



Conditions improve



Drift subsides



AI-CELL:



Enters RECOVERY



No further action



Cooldown applied



Message:



"It knows when to stop."



Minute 4--5: Review



Show decision log



Show state timeline



Show monitors stable



Final Message:



"We didn't add alerts.

We added judgment."



Success Criteria



The demo is successful if the CTO says:



"This is predictable"



"This would reduce noise"



"I trust this not to overreact"
